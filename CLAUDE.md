# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Teacher Assist is a Django-based web application designed to help Polish kindergarten teachers plan their monthly lessons. The application uses AI to automatically fill educational metadata (modules, curriculum references, and objectives) based on planned activities entered by the teacher.

**Key characteristics:**
- Interface and AI responses are in Polish
- MVP focused on local deployment (no user authentication)
- Single-page application with tabular data display
- Designed for easy copying to Google Docs
- **Training project:** This project serves as a learning opportunity for Claude Code, Django, and LangGraph

## Technology Stack

- **Web Framework**: Django 5.2.7
- **Database**: SQLite (development)
- **AI Backend**: Python + LangGraph (planned integration)
- **Language**: Python 3.12+

## Development Commands

All Django commands should be run from the `webserver/` directory.

**Start development server:**
```bash
cd webserver
python manage.py runserver
```

**Database migrations:**
```bash
cd webserver
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

**Create superuser:**
```bash
cd webserver
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
cd webserver
python manage.py test
```

**Django shell:**
```bash
cd webserver
python manage.py shell
```

## Application Requirements

**See [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md) for detailed product requirements, user stories, and functional specifications.**

Quick summary: Single-page table interface for lesson planning with AI-powered autofill of educational metadata (modules, curriculum references, objectives) based on teacher-entered activities. Interface in Polish, designed for easy copying to Google Docs.

## AI Integration Architecture

**Two-Process Design:** Django web server (port 8000) + LangGraph AI service (port 8001) communicating via REST API.

**See [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md) Section 7 for detailed API contract, database schema, and LangGraph workflow specs.**

### Starting Both Services

**Terminal 1 - LangGraph Service:**
```bash
python ai_service/main.py
# Runs on http://localhost:8001
```

**Terminal 2 - Django Server:**
```bash
cd webserver
python manage.py runserver
# Runs on http://localhost:8000
```

### Quick Reference

- **AI Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:8001/api/generate-metadata`
- **LLM Gateway:** OpenRouter (for model flexibility)
- **Budget:** ~$1/month (use cost-effective models)
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds
- **Language:** Polish (UI and AI responses)

## Database

**SQLite is intentionally used** and the database file (`webserver/db.sqlite3`) **is committed to git** for portability. This allows pre-populated curriculum data to work across different systems without setup.

**See [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md) Section 7.5 for database schema details.**

**Note:** MVP has no data persistence for lesson plans (session-only). Future phases will add save/load functionality.

## Git Workflow

This project uses **trunk-based development** with the following conventions:

**Branch naming:**
- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branches: `feature/c_<description>` (prefix `c_` indicates Claude-created branches)

**Workflow rules:**
1. **Continuing existing work:** If already on a feature branch, continue working on that branch
2. **Starting from main:** If on `main` branch, create a new feature branch: `feature/c_<description>`
3. **Starting new task:** When beginning a new task:
   - Suggest merging and pushing the current feature branch
   - Create a new feature branch (typically from the latest feature branch)

**Example:**
```bash
# Starting new work from main
git checkout -b feature/c_lesson_planning_ui

# Starting new task after completing previous work
git add . && git commit -m "Complete lesson planning UI"
git push origin feature/c_lesson_planning_ui
git checkout -b feature/c_ai_integration
```

## Development Guidelines

### Package Management

**ALWAYS ask before installing new packages via pip.**

The developer wants to maintain control over project dependencies. When a new package is needed:
1. Suggest the package and explain why it's needed
2. Wait for explicit approval before installing
3. After approval, install and document in requirements.txt

### Project Purpose

This is a **training project** for learning:
- Claude Code capabilities and workflows
- Django web framework
- LangGraph AI integration

Keep implementations educational and well-commented where appropriate.

## Settings Notes

- `DEBUG = True` for local development
- `LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-us'` in settings but application content is Polish
- `SECRET_KEY` is development-only (insecure placeholder)
- Database: SQLite at `webserver/db.sqlite3` (committed to git)
