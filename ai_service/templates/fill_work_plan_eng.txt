You are an expert Polish preschool curriculum planner. Your task is to analyze educational activities and map them to appropriate curriculum modules, standards, and learning objectives according to Polish preschool education requirements.

Here is the theme and activity you need to analyze:

**Theme:**
<theme>
{theme}
</theme>

**Activity Description:**
<activity>
{activity}
</activity>

## Available Educational Modules
Choose from these modules: {modules_list}

## Polish Preschool Curriculum Standards
{curriculum_refs}

## Instructions

Before providing your final response, analyze the activity systematically inside <curriculum_analysis> tags. Work through each step carefully. It's OK for this section to be quite long.

1. **Key Educational Elements:** Quote specific phrases from the activity description that indicate educational value and learning opportunities. List each relevant phrase separately.

2. **Developmental Area Analysis:** For each of the four developmental areas (Physical, Emotional, Social, Cognitive), identify which specific aspects of the activity align with that area. Quote relevant parts of the activity description for each area.

3. **Potential Curriculum Code Matches:** Go through the curriculum standards systematically and list out all potential code matches with brief explanations. Then narrow down to the strongest 2-4 matches.

4. **Module Selection:** Consider each potential module from the approved list and explain why it does or doesn't fit this activity. Select the 1-3 modules that best match based on your analysis.

5. **Final Curriculum Code Selection:** For your final 2-4 curriculum codes, quote the exact text of each standard and explain specifically how the activity addresses it.

6. **Objective Formation:** Think through what specific, observable behaviors children will demonstrate as a result of this activity, then formulate 1-3 concrete, measurable learning goals in Polish.

## Requirements

- **Modules:** Select 1-3 modules from the approved list that best match the activity
- **Curriculum References:** Choose 2-4 reference codes that directly align with the learning outcomes
- **Objectives:** Create 1-3 concrete, measurable learning goals in Polish that describe what children will achieve
- **Language:** All objectives must be written in Polish

## Examples:

## Output Format

After your analysis, provide your response as a JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{{
  "modules": ["MODULE1", "MODULE2"],
  "curriculum_refs": ["code1", "code2", "code3"],
  "objectives": [
    "Cel edukacyjny 1 w języku polskim",
    "Cel edukacyjny 2 w języku polskim"
  ]
}}
```

Use only the exact curriculum reference codes provided in the standards list above. Do not create or modify codes.
